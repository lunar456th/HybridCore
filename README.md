# HybridCore
Microprocessor Design Project

The goal of this project is to make ~~heterogeneous multicore processor using LEGv8 core and OISC core...~~ manycore processor with mips architecture and to connect with external memory(DD3 SDRAM) on FPGA board using memory interface generator(MIG).

In progress...
